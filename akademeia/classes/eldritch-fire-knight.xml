    <description>
      <p>The archetypical Eldritch Fire Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards, but they focus predominantly on offensive and defensive magics, weaving primal arcane elements into their attacks. The Eldritch Knight seeks to dominate the battlefield with both cunning and might.</p>
			<h4>FORGED IN FIRE</h4>
      <p>Beginning at 3rd level, you weave elemental fire into your melee attacks.</p>
			<p class="indent">The damage type of your bonded weapon attacks change to fire. You may revert its damage back to its original type as a bonus action, this lasts until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">You deal an additional 1d8 Fire damage each time your bonded weapon deals damage. This fire will ignote combustable materials that are not worn or held.</p>

			<h4>FORGED IN FIRE</h4>
      <p>starting at 7th level, you are resistance to fire damage. Your fire damage is peicing, ignoring any fire resistance the target may have.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><em>Consume your Foes:</em></b> You can stoke the flames of your attacks to also consume foes near your target. The fire damage of your bonded weapon attacks now also affects any foes adjacent to your primary target. As a bonus action, you cause all adjacent foes (within 5 feet) to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier) or take an equal amount of fire damage. On success they take half damage.</p>
